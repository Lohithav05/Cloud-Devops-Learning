REVISION OF 1st WEEK
## AWS Cloud Model

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform offering over 200 services, including compute, storage, databases, and analytics. AWS operates on a pay-as-you-go model, allowing users to access scalable IT resources without upfront hardware investments. It supports various deployment models, including public, private, and hybrid clouds.

## Client-Server Model in AWS

The client-server model in AWS involves clients (e.g., web browsers, applications) sending requests to servers hosted on AWS infrastructure, such as Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud). EC2 instances act as virtual servers that process requests and return responses, enabling scalable and secure application hosting. This model supports dynamic interactions, with AWS services like Elastic Load Balancing distributing client requests across multiple servers for optimal performance.

## Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of IT resources (compute, storage, databases) over the internet, eliminating the need for on-premises infrastructure. AWS provides cloud computing services that allow businesses to scale resources, reduce costs, and deploy applications globally with minimal latency. Key characteristics include on-demand access, elasticity, and pay-as-you-go pricing.

## Types of Cloud Services

AWS offers three main types of cloud services:

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides fundamental IT resources like virtual servers (EC2), storage (S3), and networking (VPC). Users have high control over infrastructure but manage operating systems and applications.
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Simplifies application development by managing underlying infrastructure (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk). Users focus on application deployment and management.
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Fully managed applications hosted and maintained by AWS or third-party vendors, requiring only user interaction (e.g., web-based email services).

## AWS Infrastructure

AWS infrastructure includes compute, storage, networking, and database services, managed across global data centers. Key components:
- **Compute**: EC2, Lambda, Elastic Container Service (ECS).
- **Storage**: S3, Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic File System (EFS).
- **Networking**: Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Route 53, CloudFront.
- **Databases**: RDS, DynamoDB, Redshift.

## Benefits of AWS

- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go pricing reduces capital expenditure (CapEx) compared to on-premises solutions.
- **Scalability**: Resources scale up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Global Reach**: Deploy applications across multiple regions for low latency and high availability.
- **Security**: Over 300 security services, compliance with 143 standards, and features like VPC and encryption.
- **Flexibility**: Wide range of instance types, operating systems, and integrations with services like Lambda and S3.
- **Reliability**: High availability through multiple Availability Zones (AZs) and redundancy.

## AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS operates in 31 geographic regions with 99 Availability Zones (AZs) as of 2023, ensuring low-latency access and high availability. Each region contains multiple AZs, isolated locations with independent power and networking to enhance fault tolerance. Edge locations (e.g., 31 in North America) support content delivery via CloudFront. Users can deploy EC2 instances across regions for latency optimization and redundancy.

## Amazon EC2 Instances

Amazon EC2 provides resizable compute capacity through virtual servers (instances). Key features:
- **Instance Types**: 
  - **General Purpose**: Balanced resources for web servers, code repositories (e.g., M8g, T4g).
  - **Compute Optimized**: High-performance processors for HPC, gaming (e.g., C8g).
  - **Memory Optimized**: High memory for databases, analytics.
  - **Storage Optimized**: High I/O for large-scale data processing.
  - **Accelerated Computing**: GPUs or AI chips for ML, simulations (e.g., UltraServers).
- **Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)**: Templates for instance configurations, supporting various OS (Linux, Windows, Ubuntu).
- **Security**: Runs in VPCs with security groups for network control; Nitro System encrypts instance communication.

## EC2 Pricing

EC2 offers flexible pricing models:
- **On-Demand**: Pay per second for active instances, no upfront commitment (e.g., $0.0058/hour for t2.nano).
- **Reserved Instances**: Up to 72% discount for 1- or 3-year commitments.
- **Spot Instances**: Up to 90% discount for interruptible workloads, ideal for flexible tasks.
- **Savings Plans**: Flexible pricing for compute usage across AWS services.
- **Free Tier**: 750 hours/month of t2.micro or t4g.small instances for new users.
- Additional costs: Data transfer, EBS volumes, snapshots. Use AWS Cost Explorer for analysis.

## Scaling in AWS EC2

EC2 supports dynamic scaling to handle varying workloads:
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts instance count based on metrics (e.g., CPU utilization, request count). Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) define minimum, maximum, and desired instance counts.
- **Elastic Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across instances for performance and fault tolerance.
- **Predictive Scaling**: Uses ML to anticipate demand and provision instances proactively.
- **Tools**: AWS Compute Optimizer and Trusted Advisor optimize resource allocation and costs.

## Getting Started

1. **Create an AWS Account**: Sign up at aws.amazon.com to access EC2 and other services.
2. **Launch EC2 Instances**: Use the AWS Management Console, CLI, or CloudFormation to configure AMIs, instance types, and VPCs.
3. **Monitor and Optimize**: Use CloudWatch for performance metrics and Cost Explorer for billing insights.
4. **Learn More**: Explore AWS documentation (docs.aws.amazon.com) or AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner resources for deeper understanding.
