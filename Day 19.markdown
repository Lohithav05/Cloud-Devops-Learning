# Cloud DevOps Learning Journey - Day 19
**Date**: July 28, 2025  


## Overview
On Day 19 of the Cloud DevOps learning journey, we explored the management and monitoring of network traffic within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). This topic covers the fundamentals of how network traffic flows in a VPC, including key concepts such as subnets, route tables, security groups, network access control lists (NACLs), and tools for monitoring and optimizing traffic.

## Key Concepts Covered
1. **VPC Basics**:
   - A VPC is a virtual network in the cloud that allows you to define an isolated section for your resources.
   - Components include subnets (public and private), internet gateways, NAT gateways, and VPC endpoints.

2. **Network Traffic Flow**:
   - Understanding inbound and outbound traffic in a VPC.
   - Role of route tables in directing traffic between subnets and external networks.
   - Difference between stateful (security groups) and stateless (NACLs) firewall rules.

3. **Security Groups and NACLs**:
   - Security groups act as virtual firewalls at the instance level, controlling traffic based on rules.
   - NACLs provide an additional layer of security at the subnet level with stateless filtering.

4. **Monitoring Network Traffic**:
   - Tools like Amazon VPC Flow Logs for capturing detailed information about IP traffic.
   - Using CloudWatch to analyze logs and set up alerts for unusual traffic patterns.
   - Packet sniffing and analysis for troubleshooting (e.g., using tools like Wireshark with VPC mirroring).

5. **Best Practices**:
   - Structuring subnets to segregate workloads (e.g., public for web servers, private for databases).
   - Implementing least privilege in security group and NACL rules.
   - Regularly reviewing flow logs to detect anomalies and optimize performance.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to configure and manage network traffic in a VPC.
- Learn to secure VPC traffic using security groups and NACLs.
- Gain hands-on experience with VPC Flow Logs and CloudWatch for traffic monitoring.
- Explore real-world scenarios for optimizing and troubleshooting network traffic.
