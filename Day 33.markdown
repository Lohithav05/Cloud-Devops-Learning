# Cloud Engineering & DevOps Learning Journey - Day 33 
Date:11.08.2025

## Overview
Welcome to Day 33 of your cloud engineering and cloud DevOps learning journey! By now, you’ve likely gained a foundational understanding of cloud computing concepts, such as IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and key cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP). Today’s focus is on **building a structured study plan** to deepen your cloud knowledge, with an emphasis on core cloud services, hands-on practice, and aligning your learning with cloud engineering and DevOps career goals. This README provides a clear, actionable plan for studying cloud computing effectively, including what to learn, resources, and practical tasks for Day 33.


## Why a Study Plan Matters
A well-structured study plan ensures consistent progress, prevents overwhelm, and aligns your learning with industry demands. Cloud engineering and DevOps roles require proficiency in cloud services, automation, and collaboration tools, so today’s plan will help you prioritize and organize your efforts effectively.

## Today’s Study Plan
### 1. Define Your Learning Goals
- **Why It Matters:** Clear goals keep you focused and motivated.
- **Task:** Spend 15 minutes outlining your objectives for the next 30 days. Examples:
  - Master core cloud services (compute, storage, networking) on AWS/Azure/GCP.
  - Build 2–3 hands-on projects for your portfolio (e.g., deploying a web app).
  - Prepare for an entry-level certification (e.g., AWS Cloud Practitioner).
- **Tip:** Choose one cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) to focus on for the next few weeks to avoid spreading yourself too thin.

### 2. Study Core Cloud Services
- **What to Learn:**
  - **Compute:** Virtual machines (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs, GCP Compute Engine).
  - **Storage:** Object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Cloud Storage) and block storage.
  - **Networking:** Virtual networks, subnets, and load balancers (e.g., AWS VPC, Azure Virtual Network, GCP VPC).
- **How to Study:**
  - Spend 1 hour reading/watching tutorials on one service (e.g., AWS EC2 or Azure VMs).
  - Take notes on key concepts: instance types, pricing models, and use cases.
- **Resources:**
  - AWS: [EC2 Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)
  - Azure: [Introduction to Azure Virtual Machines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/overview)
  - GCP: [Compute Engine Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs)
  - Video: [Cloud Computing Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pBuwKwaHp0) by freeCodeCamp

### 3. Hands-On Practice: Deploy a Cloud Resource
- **Why It Matters:** Hands-on experience reinforces theoretical knowledge and builds confidence.
- **Project Idea:** Launch a virtual machine (VM) and configure it to host a simple web server.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Set Up Your Cloud Account:**
     - Use the free tier of your chosen platform (AWS, Azure, or GCP).
     - Ensure you have access to the console and necessary permissions.
  2. **Deploy a VM:**
     - AWS: Launch an EC2 instance with a Linux AMI and install a web server (e.g., Apache).
     - Azure: Create a Linux VM and set up a simple web server.
     - GCP: Use Compute Engine to deploy a VM and host a basic webpage.
  3. **Test Your Deployment:** Access the web server via its public IP (e.g., `http://<your-vm-ip>`).
  4. **Clean Up:** Terminate the VM to avoid unexpected costs.
- **Resources:**
  - AWS: [Tutorial: Launch a Web Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html)
  - Azure: [Quickstart: Create a Linux VM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal)
  - GCP: [Deploying a Web Server](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/running-web-server)
- **Time Estimate:** 1–1.5 hours.

### 4. Organize Your Study Schedule
- **Daily Plan (1–2 Hours/Day):**
  - 30 minutes: Study theory (read documentation/watch videos).
  - 1 hour: Hands-on practice (e.g., deploy resources, troubleshoot errors).
  - 15 minutes: Document what you learned (notes, blog post, or portfolio update).
- **Weekly Plan:**
  - Week 1–2: Focus on compute and storage services.
  - Week 3–4: Explore networking and security (e.g., IAM, firewalls).
  - Week 5+: Start a mini-project (e.g., deploy a full-stack app).
- **Tools to Stay Organized:**
  - Use Notion or Trello to track your progress.
  - Set reminders for daily study sessions.

### 5. Document Your Learning
- **Why It Matters:** Documenting helps reinforce knowledge and builds a portfolio for job applications.
- **Task:** Create a GitHub repository for your cloud projects.
  - Add a README describing today’s VM deployment.
  - Include screenshots of your cloud console (e.g., EC2 instance running).
  - Note challenges faced and how you resolved them.
- **Tip:** Share your repository link on X or with a study group like NextWork to get feedback.
