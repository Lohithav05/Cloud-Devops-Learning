# Cloud DevOps Learning Journey: Day 34
Date:12.08.2025

Welcome to Day 34 of the Cloud DevOps Learning Journey! Today, we focus on practical, hands-on cloud-based project ideas to enhance your skills in cloud computing and DevOps. These projects are designed to provide real-world experience, covering beginner to intermediate concepts using popular cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Each project emphasizes key DevOps principles such as automation, CI/CD, containerization, and infrastructure as code (IaC).

## Project Ideas

### 1. Deploy a Static Website with AWS S3 and CloudFront
**Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Objective**: Learn to host a static website using AWS services and configure a Content Delivery Network (CDN).  
**Tasks**:  
- Create an S3 bucket and upload a simple HTML/CSS website.  
- Enable static website hosting on the S3 bucket.  
- Configure AWS CloudFront to distribute the website for faster access.  
- Set up a custom domain using Route 53 and add an SSL certificate with AWS Certificate Manager.  
**Key Concepts**: S3, CloudFront, DNS, SSL/TLS, IaC.  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Resources**: AWS Free Tier, AWS Documentation for S3 and CloudFront.

### 2. Build a CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions and Azure
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Objective**: Automate the deployment of a web application using GitHub Actions and Azure App Service.  
**Tasks**:  
- Create a simple web app (e.g., a Node.js or Python Flask app).  
- Push the code to a GitHub repository.  
- Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to run tests and deploy to Azure App Service.  
- Configure Azure App Service to host the application.  
- Test the pipeline by making changes and pushing updates.  
**Key Concepts**: CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Azure App Service, automation.  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours  
**Resources**: Azure Free Account, GitHub Actions Documentation.

### 3. Serverless API with AWS Lambda and API Gateway
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Objective**: Build a serverless REST API to perform basic CRUD operations.  
**Tasks**:  
- Create a Lambda function (e.g., using Python) to handle API requests.  
- Set up an API Gateway to expose the Lambda function as a RESTful API.  
- Use DynamoDB to store
- Configure CORS and test the API using tools like Postman.  
**Key Concepts**: Serverless computing, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB.  
**Estimated Time**: 2-4 hours  
**Resources**: AWS Free Tier, AWS Lambda Documentation.

### 4. Automate Infrastructure with Terraform on GCP
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Objective**: Use Terraform to provision a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) virtual machine and deploy a simple application.  
**Tasks**:  
- Write a Terraform configuration to create a GCP VM instance.  
- Deploy a basic web server (e.g., Nginx) on the VM.  
- Use Terraform to manage security rules and networking.  
- Test the setup by accessing the web server.  
**Key Concepts**: Infrastructure as Code, Terraform, GCP, automation.  
**Estimated Time**: 3-5 hours  
**Resources**: GCP Free Tier, Terraform Documentation.

### 5. Containerized Web App with Docker and AWS ECS
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Objective**: Deploy a containerized web application using Docker and AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS).  
**Tasks**:  
- Create a simple web app and write a Dockerfile.  
- Push the Docker image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).  
- Set up an ECS cluster and deploy the container.  
- Configure a load balancer to access the application.  
**Key Concepts**: Docker, ECS, ECR, containerization, load balancing.  
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours  
**Resources**: AWS Free Tier, Docker Documentation.

## Tips for Success
- **Start Small**: Begin with beginner-level projects to build confidence before tackling intermediate ones.  
- **Document Your Work**: Keep notes on challenges and solutions to create a portfolio.  
- **Use Free Tiers**: Leverage AWS, Azure, and GCP free tiers to minimize costs.  
- **Join Communities**: Engage with DevOps communities on platforms like GitHub or Reddit for support and feedback.
