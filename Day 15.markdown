# Cloud DevOps Learning Journey - Day 15
*Date: July 24, 2025*

## Content Covered
- **CloudFormation**: Dove into AWS CloudFormation, focusing on creating and managing infrastructure as code. Explored template structure (YAML/JSON), stack creation, and updates to automate resource provisioning efficiently.
- **Networking Components**: Studied core cloud networking concepts, including IP addressing (IPv4/IPv6), routing tables, gateways, and security groups to control traffic flow and ensure secure communication. Learned the importance of understanding connections through diagrams:
  - If you are new to IT or cloud computing, you might not have worked with architectural diagrams before. A diagram is, simply put, a schematic or map of your network in the AWS Cloud. It can provide a visual of how users or applications access services, resources, or data. A picture is worth a thousand words. With a quick glance, you can see if the network was built for redundancy, security, and even scalability. It can also serve as a blueprint so you don't forget important connections when building your solutions.
- **Amazon VPC**: Learned about Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) setup, including designing isolated network environments, configuring CIDR blocks, and managing VPC components for secure and scalable cloud infrastructure.
- **Subnet**: Understood the role of subnets within a VPC, including differences between public and private subnets, their CIDR configurations, and how they enable resource organization and network segmentation.
