## Overview
Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a comprehensive suite of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) services to help businesses integrate intelligent features into their applications. These services leverage Amazon's expertise in AI/ML to enable tasks like document processing, image analysis, natural language processing, and generative AI applications. This README outlines key AWS AI services, their use cases, and steps to get started as of August 24, 2025.

## Key AWS AI Services

- **Use Cases**: Sentiment analysis, PII redaction, and custom entity recognition.
- **Features**: Pre-trained and customizable entities, integration with serverless workflows.

### 5. Amazon Rekognition
- **Description**: A deep learning-based service for image and video analysis, capable of detecting objects, faces, and inappropriate content.
- **Use Cases**: Security monitoring, content moderation, and facial recognition.
- **Features**: Real-time and batch processing, integration with AWS Free Tier.

### 6. Amazon Transcribe
- **Description**: An automatic speech recognition (ASR) service that converts audio to text.
- **Use Cases**: Transcribing customer calls, generating subtitles, and voice-to-text applications.
- **Features**: Supports real-time and recorded audio, available in AWS Free Tier.

### 7. Amazon Q
- **Description**: A generative AI-powered assistant integrated with AWS services like QuickSight and Connect, providing insights and automating tasks.
- **Use Cases**: Building BI dashboards, answering supply chain queries, and enhancing contact center efficiency.
- **Features**: Connects to enterprise data, supports natural language queries, and ensures data security.

### 8. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
- **Description**: A service for deploying secure AI agents with fine-grained access control and integration with third-party tools.
- **Use Cases**: Automating enterprise workflows, secure agent-based task execution.
- **Features**: Identity management, serverless runtime, and support for OAuth providers.

## Getting Started
To explore AWS AI services, follow these steps to set up and deploy a basic intelligent document processing (IDP) pipeline using Amazon Textract, Amazon Comprehend, and Amazon Bedrock.

### Prerequisites
- An active AWS account with access to the AWS Management Console.
- AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate IAM permissions.
- Basic familiarity with AWS services like S3, Lambda, and Step Functions.
- Optional: AWS CDK for infrastructure as code deployment.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Create an AWS Account**:
   - Sign up for an AWS account to access the AWS Free Tier, which offers credits for testing AI services like Amazon Transcribe and Rekognition.[](https://aws.amazon.com/free/machine-learning/)
   - Navigate to the AWS Management Console.

2. **Set Up Amazon S3 Bucket**:
   - Create an S3 bucket to store documents (e.g., PDFs, JPEGs).
   - Configure bucket permissions to allow access for Textract and Lambda functions.

3. **Deploy an IDP Pipeline**:
   - Use the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) to deploy a serverless IDP pipeline. Refer to the sample architecture in the AWS documentation.[](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/)
   - Example CDK stack for IDP:
     ```bash
     cdk init app --language typescript
     npm install @aws-cdk/aws-textract @aws-cdk/aws-comprehend @aws-cdk/aws-stepfunctions
     ```
   - Define a workflow using AWS Step Functions to orchestrate document upload, extraction with Textract, and enrichment with Comprehend.

4. **Configure Amazon Textract**:
   - Use the AWS Console or CLI to start a Textract job:
     ```bash
     aws textract start-document-text-detection --document-location '{"S3Object":{"Bucket":"your-bucket-name","Name":"your-document.pdf"}}'
     ```
   - Integrate with Amazon A2I for human review if needed.[](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/part-1-intelligent-document-processing-with-aws-ai-services/)

5. **Set Up Amazon Bedrock (Optional)**:
   - Access Amazon Bedrock via the AWS Console to select a foundation model for generative AI tasks.
   - Use the Bedrock API to enhance document processing, e.g., summarization or transcreation.[](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/enhancing-aws-intelligent-document-processing-with-generative-ai/)

6. **Monitor and Evaluate**:
   - Use Amazon CloudWatch for logging and monitoring the pipeline.
   - Implement Amazon Bedrock Guardrails to ensure responsible AI usage.[](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/responsible-ai/)

### Example Use Case: Document Processing Pipeline
- **Scenario**: Automate invoice processing for a business.
- **Steps**:
  1. Upload invoices to an S3 bucket.
  2. Trigger a Textract job to extract text and key-value pairs.
  3. Use Comprehend to identify entities (e.g., invoice number, total amount).
  4. Store results in a NoSQL database like DynamoDB.
  5. Optionally, use Amazon Bedrock to generate summaries or validate data with FMs.
