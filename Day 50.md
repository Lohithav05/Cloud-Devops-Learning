# Cloud devops learning journey -Day 50
Date:29.08.25

## Overview

This document provides an introduction to Amazon Web Services (AWS) security practices, focusing on how AWS ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data. AWS delivers a scalable cloud computing platform designed for high availability and dependability, offering tools to help customers meet their security objectives. This README highlights key AWS security concepts, services, and best practices.

> **Note**: Some AWS security whitepapers, such as the "Introduction to AWS Security" (published November 11, 2021), are for historical reference only and may contain outdated content or broken links. For the latest information, refer to [AWS Security and Compliance](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/security-identity-compliance/).


## AWS Shared Responsibility Model

AWS operates under a **Shared Responsibility Model**, where:
- **AWS** is responsible for the security *of* the cloud (e.g., physical infrastructure, host operating systems, and virtualization layers).
- **Customers** are responsible for security *in* the cloud (e.g., managing data, configuring applications, and securing access).

This model ensures that AWS maintains a secure foundation, while customers have the flexibility to implement security controls tailored to their needs. For details, see the [AWS Shared Responsibility Model documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/).

## Key Security Services

AWS provides a range of services to help customers secure their applications and data. Key services include:

- **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Manage user access and permissions to AWS resources securely.
- **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**: Create and manage cryptographic keys for encrypting data.
- **AWS Shield**: Protect applications from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
- **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: Filter and monitor HTTP traffic to protect web applications.
- **Amazon GuardDuty**: Monitor for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior in your AWS environment.
- **AWS Security Hub**: Centralize and prioritize security alerts and findings across AWS services.

## Security Best Practices

To secure your AWS environment, follow these best practices:

1. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Require MFA for all users, especially for privileged actions.
2. **Use Strong IAM Policies**: Apply the principle of least privilege to grant only necessary permissions.
3. **Encrypt Data**: Use AWS KMS or other tools to encrypt data at rest and in transit.
4. **Monitor and Log Activity**: Enable AWS CloudTrail for API call logging and Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring.
5. **Regularly Patch and Update**: Keep applications and operating systems updated to address vulnerabilities.
6. **Implement Network Security**: Use Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configurations, security groups, and network ACLs to control traffic.

For detailed guidance, refer to the [AWS Security Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security/best-practices/) (check for the latest version).

## Getting Started

To begin securing your AWS environment:
1. **Create an AWS Account**: Sign up at [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com).
2. **Explore the AWS Management Console**: Navigate to the Security, Identity, and Compliance section.
3. **Enable Key Services**: Start with IAM to set up users and permissions, and enable CloudTrail for logging.
4. **Review AWS Security Training**: Access free training at [AWS Skill Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/training/).
